"""Slice the leading N ns out of a trajectory that is still being written.

Taken from `boltzgen_local/md/window_live.py`, which computed its MM/GBSA convergence series while the
dynamics was still running. Kept here so this repository does not depend on that one for a window.

Two reasons not to use `mdtraj.load` here. It reads the whole file, which for a 5,000-particle
system at 20 ns is on the order of 700 MB resident and grows as the run does -- on a machine
already swapping under the dynamics, that is the expensive part of a window, not MMPBSA.py.
And the file is being appended to, so the last frame on disk can be half-written; `iterload`
with an explicit frame budget reads only what is asked for and stops.

A margin of a few frames is left at the end for the same reason.

The frame budget has to come from how much has been *written*, not from how long the run
will eventually be: the file grows, so a fraction of the final length is meaningless while it
is still going. Elapsed nanoseconds are read from energy.csv, whose first column is the step.

Usage: python window_live.py <traj.dcd> <topology.pdb> <out.dcd> <want_ns> <energy.csv>
